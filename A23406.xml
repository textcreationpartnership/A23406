            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But, before her iourney, she meant to arme her ſelfe with the holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> &amp;, in the ſtrength of that deſire, she went and caſt her ſelfe, at the feet of <hi>Doctour Auila,</hi> in the way of <hi>Confeſſion.</hi> She would after ſay, that he reprooued her a little sharply, for bringing a hart, which pretended to be penitent for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, in a body ſet out, &amp; ardorned too curiouſly, &amp; too coſtly for ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

<pb facs="tcp:331:11"/>to the world. For she, inſtantly, did vnturne Courtier; she grew quickly to caſt away her vaine, and ſumptuous attires; and she betooke her ſelfe (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh only in her Fathers houſe) to a courſe of admirable pennance, &amp; recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, which she accompanied with a <hi>Vow</hi> of <hi>perpetuall chaſtity;</hi> wherein she dyed, moſt holily, and moſt happily, ſome ten yeares after. This <hi>Lady</hi> then as being the <hi>Child,</hi> and <hi>Creature</hi> (as it were) in ſpirit of <hi>Doctour Auila,</hi> was deare to him, after an extraordinary manner.

               <p>VVE are much to marke, that the remedy of which I haue ſpoken in afflicting the <hi>body,</hi> is wont to help, when the tentation ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth from the <hi>body;</hi> as it vſeth to do in young men, who haue good health, and haue vſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale themſelues. Then,<note n="a" place="margin">Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall root, &amp; motiue of the tentation, ſo is the remedy to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note> I ſay, it is fit to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the <hi>body,</hi> when the roote of the infirmity ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thence. But ſometymes, the tentation grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:331:26"/>by meanes of the <hi>Diuell;</hi> and it may partly be perceaued by this; that it fighteth with vs more by thoughts, &amp; foule imaginations of the mind, then by impure motions of the body. Or if you find theſe later alſo in your <hi>body,</hi> it is not becauſe the tentation began there; but hauing begun by thoughts, it groweth, at laſt to reſult into the exteriour. Which exteriour of the body being ſometymes extremely weake, and little better then dead; euill thoughts are yet, now and then, moſt liuely in it; as it happened to <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> according to his owne relation. It is alſo another ſigne, that ſuch tentations are of the <hi>Diuell;</hi> when they come vpon a ſuddayne; and when a man giueth leaſt occaſion, or hath cauſe to expect them leaſt. Nor<note n="b" place="margin">There is no ſin at all, if no occaſion, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent be giuen, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure taken in the ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of carnall thoughts.</note> can he, as it may happen, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue due reuerence, in the very tymes of his <hi>Prayer;</hi> no nor at the <hi>Altar,</hi> nor in other holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; where yet euen a very wicked man, would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider where he were, &amp; abſtayn from thinking of ſuch things. Sometymes<note n="c" place="margin">Note.</note> theſe thoughts are ſuch in quality, and ſo many in number, as that a man neuer knew, nor heard, nor imagined any ſuch things, as do then preſent themſelues. And by the force, wherewith they come, and by the very things themſelues, which interiourly are told him; a man findes that they ſpring not from himſelfe; but that it is ſomewhat els, which ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and repreſented them, to his mind.</p>
               <p>When you haue theſe, or ſuch other ſignes as theſe, be well aſſured that it is a perſecution of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:331:26"/>the <hi>Diuell;</hi> and that, howſoeuer you may ſuffer it in your <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> yet is it not from thence, that it proceeds. This warre is more dangerous then the other; through the much euill which he wiſheth vs, by whome it is made; and for that he is an enemy, that is neuer weary of fighting, when we are eyther waking, or ſleeping, at all tymes, and in all places. The remedy of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, is<note n="d" place="margin">To put thy ſelfe vpon ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion.</note> to procure ſome good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which may put vs into thought, and care; making vs thereby, caſt off, thoſe impure imaginations. <hi>S.

And after,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:331:30"/>being fallen, they learne, that a man and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, are but fire and flaxe; and that the Diuells errand, is but to bring them neere one another; and when they are ſo, he blowes the bellowes with a thouſand arts, &amp; tricks, to inflame them heere, with the fire of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Bloud;</hi> and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them afterwards into that of hell.</p>
               <p>Therefore thou, O <hi>Virgin,</hi> fly away from the familiarity of euery man; and continue, to the end of thy life, in that good cuſtome, which thou haſt begunne, to be neuer alone with any man; except thy <hi>Confeſſour;</hi> and that, no longer then why leſt thou art making thy <hi>Confeſsion;</hi> &amp; yet euen let that, be diſpatched with as much breuity as thou canſt; without enterlacing other diſcourſes; fearing the account of the ſpeach that thou ſhalt either vtter, or heare, which thou art to giue vnto the ſtrict iudge.

               </p>
               <p>Thou<note n="(f)" place="margin">Note.</note> muſt alſo be prouided, for the looſing him, without loſſe of thy patience, if God ſhall ſo ordayne, in whome alone thou art to lodge thy hopes, and he is to be thy only reſting place. That which we read in <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:331:31"/>loue and familiarity between him and <hi>S. Paula,</hi> did keep conformity with theſe rules. Though yet many thinges are lawfull, and ſafe, to them who haue <hi>ſanctity,</hi> and <hi>mature yeares,</hi> which yet are not ſo to ſuch others, as want one of theſe qualityes, if not both.</p>
               <p>In this ſort then, art thou to carry thy ſelfe, with the <hi>Ghoſtly Father,</hi> whome thou chooſeſt, he being ſuch as I haue deſcribed. But if thou canſt not haue him ſuch, it is much better, that thou<note n="(g)" place="margin">By this he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the great care which a Virgin ought to haue, of her good name; though ſuch as liue not in villages, but in townes, can haue no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, to find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moſt worthy Ghoſtly Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at whoſe handes they may receaue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as often as they will do it with deuotion.</note> confeſſe and communicate but twice or thrice in the yeare, and keep good account with God, and with thy ſpirituall bookes in thy <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> then by confeſſing often, to bring thy fame into hazard. For if, as <hi>S.

And that ſo much, as that to haue a confeſſour who wanteth any of the former qualityes, doth caſt a ſpot v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her fame; which becauſe it is in ſo pretious, and pure a cloth, it ſeemes to be very deformed, and in no caſe to be endured. And to the end that they, who content themſelues with ſaying, <hi>There is no hurt, my conſcience is cleare;</hi> and, who haue the reputation of their honeſty, in ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſhould not be able to help themſelues with a conceit, that men impoſed any of theſe infamies, vpon the moſt ſacred <hi>Virgin Mary;</hi> it<note n="(h)" place="margin">Note.</note> pleaſed her <hi>most bleſſed Sonne,</hi> that ſhe ſhould be

               <p>Therefore let ſuch as haue no care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent ſcandalls, ſeeke out ſome other ſhelter; for that which they may learne of the moſt ſacred <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and of other holy women, is <hi>purity</hi> within, and good example without; togeather with all reſeruation, and caution, in conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>This ſinne of <hi>Pride</hi> is ſo hard to be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and conſequently ſo much to be feared; that ſometymes a man hath it ſo conueyed into the moſt ſecret corners of his hart, that euen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnderſtands it not.

               <p>THE concluſion that thou muſt draw out of all this, is, That ſince it doth ſo much import to go on comforted, with a good hope, and with alacrity, in the ſeruice of God, thou muſt procure two thinges towards it.

               <p>SO great is the enuy which the Diuells haue of our happineſſe, as that they alwayes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to keepe vs from enioying, that, which themſelues loſt. And when, in any battayle, they goe away ouercome by vs, or (to ſpeake more truly) by Almighty God; they are ſtill ranging more, and more battailes, if ſo peraduenture they may find ſome careleſſe perſon to be defeated. They change their weapons, and their manner of fighting; in hope that whom now they ouercame not, they may, afterward. And ſo, when they haue diſcouered, that they could not intangle vs, by craft (for as much as we are guy ded by true Chriſtian doctrine, which telleth vs that we muſt commit our ſelues to the moſt iuſt <hi>will</hi> of God, &amp; that patiently we muſt ſuffer what he ſendeth vs, eyther from without, or within) they reſolue to denounce, an open warre; and he maketh himſelfe a fierce <hi>Lion,</hi> who was before a <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> but concealed. He aymeth at one thing, and thruſteth at another; and more boldly doth
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:331:83"/>he procure to make himſelfe be feared; concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that he may obtaine that by giuing frightes, which he was not able to doe by other crafty meanes. Heere ſhall you ſee him not made a foxe, but a fierce Lion; who amazeth men with his roaring, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſayth, <hi>Brethren</hi>

Theſe weapons are <hi>fayth,</hi> as <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> haue ſayd. For when a foule, through the <hi>loue</hi> of God (which is the life of <hi>fayth</hi>) deſpiſeth both the proſperity, and aduerſity of the world; and doth belieue and confide in God, whom ſhe doth not ſee; the diuel muſt not thinke to haue an entrance there.</p>

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, in the high preſence of God, we are to be proſtrate, and in feare, leaſt he abandone vs for our ſinnes; yet in tyme of warre, when we are aſſaulted by our enemy, it is wholy fit that we be full of courage, deſpiſing him, and implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the aſſiſtance of our Lord.</p>
               <p>In this ſort do we read, that our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe prayed to his <hi>Father,</hi> before his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being proſtrate and full of anguiſh; and from thence he went, ſo full of courage, as that himſelfe paſſed out, to meete his enemies. The prime intention of the Diuell in this battaile, is to depriue our hart of courage, to the end that ſo, we may giue ouer the good courſe begun. This he procureth, by taking ſometymes the figure of a <hi>Dragon,</hi> or of a <hi>Bull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And other effects there are like theſe, which giue reſtimony, how that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall wolfe is not far off. It is plaine, that ſince all the myſtery of his warre, workes by feare; the principal weapon that we are to haue, is ſtrength of hart; being encouraged, not through our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:331:84"/>in our ſelues, but by a faithfull truſt in our Lord. This is the thing which in this warre, doth make vs victorious; for confidence ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth feare, as it is written: <hi>I</hi>

               <p>It is true which S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayth, <hi>That the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thinges paſt, giueth aſsurance concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things to come.</hi> And ſince men are wont to truſt others, vpon taking pawnes, we ſeeme not to do much for God, if we hope for a deliuerance out of future tribulation, ſince he hath ſo often done it, in tymes paſt. It<note n="(a)" place="margin">A liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, wherin we ought to take much comfort.</note> is certayne that if any man ſhould haue made vs find his loue and fauour, in ſuccouring vs ten, or twelue ſeuerall times, in our troubles; we ſhould belieue he loued vs; and that ſtill he would do vs fauour, if, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflictions of ours we ſhould haue need. And why then ſhall we not haue a confident beliefe, that God will defend vs in all our dangers; ſince they are not twelue, but many more tymes, that we haue taken experience of his ſuccour, in our tribulations. Remember well, how often he hath drawen thee, with victory, out of thoſe ſharpe skirmiſhes of thyne againſt thy aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:331:88"/>and thou wert gratefull vnto him for it; and thereupon thou didſt conceaue a reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, and confide, that he loued thee; ſince after the tempeſt, he ſent fayre weather; and ioy after teares; and ſince he had byn thy true Father, and defendour.</p>
               <p>And why then, if now he pleaſe to try thy confidence, thy loue, and thy patience, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tribulation, (as if he hid himſelfe, becauſe he anſwereth not to thy cryes) doſt thou let thy ſelfe fall, into ſuch weakeneſſe, as that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent triall which commeth to thee, maketh thee looſe the confidence, which in many former proofes, thou hadſt gained. It is true, that we feele thoſe things moſt, which at the preſent lye vpon vs; and if thou markeſt the ſtraytes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou findeſt thy ſelfe, and how our Lord doth not free thee of them, thou wilt perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, that our Lord hath layd aſide the care, which formerly he had of thee; and thou wilt ſay, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, in that great ſea-tempeſt, to our Lord, who then was ſleeping, <hi>Maiſter</hi>

                  <hi>doest thou not care, though we periſh;</hi> and thus wilt thou be ouertaken, by the reprehenſion of that ſcripture, which ſayth, <hi>The foole changeth like the moone;</hi> Becauſe it is ſometymes after one manner, and ſometymes after another. And thou wilt be like a <hi>Vane,</hi> vpon the top of a houſe, which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to many changes in one day, becauſe it is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by euery wind. Thou wert in poſſeſſion of our Lord, as one that was carefull of thee, and

And becauſe now, there blowes another wind, wherewith our Lord is pleaſed to prooue, and trouble thee; thou art no longer of that beliefe, and confidence, which before thou hadſt. So that thou doeſt belieue, but what thou ſeeſt; &amp; thou doſt not valew our Lord, but according to that, which at the inſtant tyme, he doth towards thee; without helping thy ſelfe; of that which thou haſt tried at many other tymes, that ſo at the preſent, thou mayſt be comforted in our Lord.</p>
               <p>A ſtrange incredulity was theirs, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſeene the meruayles of God in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the victories, and fauours, which he wrought for them, in the <hi>deſert;</hi> would not take his word, whereby he told them, that they ſhould enter into <hi>the land of promiſe.</hi> For this, ſayth <hi>S.

               <p>IT is poſſible that ſome may doubt of the truth of our witneſſes, which ſpeake, and write of the multitude of <hi>miracles</hi> which haue byn wroght in the Chriſtian Church. For as they are peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who deteſt our <hi>faith;</hi> ſo it ſeemeth to them, that if theſe witneſſes ſhould be true, they muſt not fayle to confeſſe, that we haue much more reaſon to belieue our <hi>Truth,</hi> then they, their <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> But I aske, that (ſince they will not giue credit to our witneſſes; and therefore they refuſe to receyue our <hi>fayth</hi>) why giue they credit to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:331:96"/>their owne witneſſes, in receiuing their falſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hefe. Whereas<note n="(i)" place="margin">A wiſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</note> it is certaine, and cleere, that if they would take the paines to conſider it, our witneſſes do far exceed theirs, in all kind of weight of authority. There haue byn men, in the Chriſtian Church, whoſe<note n="(k)" place="margin">The high ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and piety of many Catholike Chriſtians</note> life hath eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently byn ſo good, as to prooue, that they were free from all couetouſneſſe; from all appetite of honour; and from all that which flouriſheth, and is eſteemed in the world; being full of all vertue, and <hi>Truth;</hi> ſo farre, as to dye, rather then looſe it. To what intereſt can he pretend, by the teſtimony that he giueth, who doth not only not pretend to any thing of this world, but euen that which he hath of his owne, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth away? What intereſt can mooue that man to be a falſe witneſſe, who giueth his life vnder moſt greiuous tormentes, in confirmation of what he ſayth? And though ſome vſe to be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by force of tormentes to confeſſe that which the Iudge deſires (although it be againſt <hi>truth</hi>) yet if ours would ſay that which is deſired by the Iudge, not only ſhould they not looſe their goods, and life, but much more proſperous ſhould they haue remayned, by the much which the Iudges promiſed, and would haue performed. But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing all this, they choſe to dy, that they might not abandon their <hi>faith,</hi> or vertue, which the Iudge would ſo faine haue had them looſe. So that they loued no temporall thing, nor feared they any thing that was temporall, how terrible
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:331:97"/>ſoeuer. No exception therefore can be taken to that which ſuch men ſay; and if it ſhould ſeeme to any, that theſe proofes were ſufficient to make vs hold them for good men; and that willingly they would deceaue no body, but that themſelues were yet deceaued; and did ſo deceaue others, without knowing it; To this I anſweare, that in the <hi>Church</hi> there haue byn men, ſhedding their bloud for Chriſt, ſo euidently full of<note n="(l)" place="margin">The great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of many Catholike Chriſtians who haue ſuffered death in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fayth of Chriſt.</note> wiſedom, that no reaſon can be giuen, why we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue of them that they were deceaued, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great weight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ſo far, as to looſe their liues for the ſame. For the much intereſt that a man hath in any thing, doth make him looke &amp; looke againe, what it is that he ratifyeth; nor doth a man vſe to lay downe his life, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a truth, if he be not ſufficiently certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed thereof. And it is a thing notorious, that ſo great wiſedome hath byn found among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, as therein they exceed all other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of men, no leſſe then wiſe maiſters, do ignorant ſchollers. And that there haue byn, not one, nor one hundred, but a mighty number of ſuch perſons, is a very great teſtimony of the truth of our <hi>faith;</hi> in confirmation whereof, they gaue their liues. And<note n="(m)" place="margin">Let the falſe martyrs of fooliſh Iohn Fox be vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially compared with out true ones, and their baſeneſſe, &amp; beſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, will ſoone ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</note> although we read of ſome who alſo dyed in confirmation of their Errour, yet ours do incomparably exceed them, in number, vertue, and in wiſedome.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:331:98"/>Church. Some of which hauing beene ſublimed in this world, and abounding in al kind of riches, and humane proſperity; and then at the preſent, poſſeſſing much, and expecting to inherite great ſtates, and kingdomes, haue deſpiſed all this; and to pleaſe God the more, haue choſen the life of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> in pouerty, and affliction, and in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, both to God and men. And all this, with ſo great teſtimony of vertue, both in the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and exteriour, as ſtrooke them to admiration who conuerſed with them.</p>
               <p>People there hath been in our Church, which as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, <hi>hath ſhined in the world, like lampes of heauen;</hi> and, being compared to the reſt of the world, they are found to excell them, beyond compariſon; which the moſt obſtinate perſon cannot deny, if he will but conſider the life of a S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and of the other Apoſtles, and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call men, who haue beene in the Church. And ſince there hath beene ſo great goodnes in this Chriſtian people, as by their workes we find to be euident; what ſcruple can we haue to affirme, that either there is no knowledge of God on earth, or els that theſe men had it, as perſons who were more beloued of God, and did ſerue themſelues better of his knowledge, and employ themſelues more, vpon pleaſing him that gaue it. In no ſort can it be ſayd, that the world is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſuch knowledge of God, as is neceſſary for ſaluation. For this were to ſay, that the chief creatures which God made vnder heauen, and

               <p>And ſuch was the meanes he tooke, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe man, and dying vpon a <hi>Croſse</hi> For there is not a greater ſigne of loue, then that a man ſhould dy for his friends.

               <p>And ſince the greateſt honour which we can do any man, is to hold him for <hi>good,</hi> more then for being <hi>valiant,</hi> or <hi>wiſe</hi> (for as much as no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; who is ſenſible of honour, doth not ſo deſire it) it is euident, that ſince theſe workes, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his <hi>goodnes</hi> and <hi>loue,</hi> more then all the reſt; they giue him conſequently, more <hi>honour;</hi> and they giue it better, then all the reſt.

Nor is there any thing, which doth ſo much ſtrengthen his hart, againſt the ſwooning affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which ſinne cauſeth in it; as to ſee, that God died, for the remedy thereof; and that he gaue himſelfe to man, as his owne.

And therefore he that either denyeth this worke, or hindreth it, is an enemy of God, and of all mankind. Since thereby he will depriue God of the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which, by his workes, can come to him; and man of the greateſt glory and benefit, that can be imagined. And ſince he declareth himſelf, as an enemy both to God and man, it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he be puniſhed, and that with eternall death in hell.

One is, that by the meanes of theſe deceites, he may take credit from the true <hi>reuelations</hi> of God; as he hath alſo procured, to ſhew falſe miracles, thereby to diſcredit ſuch as are true. Another is, to deceaue that perſon, vnder the ſhew of Good, now that, by other meanes, he cannot do it.

And as this ſpirit is moſt efficacious, and maketh a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a true, and feruent louer of that which is good; ſo it further putteth, ſuch a diſpoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule, when it imparteth it ſelfe aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, as that the keeping of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is not hard, but very eaſy; &amp; ſo full of guſt as that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayd, <hi>How ſweet are thy wordes to my threate, yea more then hony to my mouth.</hi> Becauſe when this ſpirit, doth place, in the will of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a moſt perfect conformity with the will of God, making it to be one ſpirit with him, and doth ſay, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>That he hath the ſame mind to will, and not to will;</hi> it muſt neceſſarily follow, that to

               <p>Therefore, to auoyd prolixity, I ſay that the holy Scripture, and the admonition of Saints, and their liues, and the experimentall knowledg that we haue; doe all, with one voyce, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to vs, that we do not leane, or reſt vpon our owne prudence, but <hi>incline our eare,</hi> to the counſayle of others. For otherwiſe what thing would there be in the world more diſorderly, then the Church of God; and the ſame would happen to any other Congregation of men, if euery one might follow his owne opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing that he is in the right. And how can it be, that the ſpirit of Chriſt, which is the ſpirit of humility, of peace, and of vnion, ſhould mooue any one to be contrary to the reſt of thoſe men, in whom God himſelfe doth dwell? And how can it grow from this ſpirit of God, that a man ſhould haue him ſelfe in ſo high eſteeme, as that there may not be found, in the whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, another, who can teach him, or
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:331:149"/>who can iudge, whether his <hi>Spirit</hi> be good, or bad. For as, <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, <hi>He would not fayle to take and follow the counſayle of others, if it were not, that through pride, he thinketh himſelfe better then the other, in giuing counſayle.</hi> And though his pride is ſo great, as to thinke that he is better then others, yet he might thinke, that as one may beleſſe good then another, and yet may haue the gift of <hi>propheſy;</hi> and power to cure <hi>ſicke perſons,</hi> and may haue ſuch <hi>giftes</hi> as theſe, (which another perhaps, may not haue, (though he be better then the former) ſo it may alſo be, that he who is inferiour in other <hi>giftes,</hi> may be yet more eminent, in the <hi>gift</hi> of affoarding counſaile; or in <hi>the diſcretion of ſpirits,</hi> which another man, who is more eminent may chaunce to want.</p>
               <p>And ſince God is ſo great a friend of <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and peace, let no man feare, that if the thing which he hath, be of God, it will go from him, or that he ſhall looſe it, only becauſe he ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe, for the loue of the ſame God, to the opinion of another; but rather it wil be more and more confirmed; and if it proceed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes, it will fly away.</p>

For a man that is only proud in will, ſometymes may be content to obey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he holdeth another mans opinion to be better; but he that is reſolued to hold his owne for beſt, who ſhall cure that man? And how ſhal he be able to obey in a thing, which he holdeth to beleſſe good? And if the eye, which is the <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> (wherewith it ſhould be able to ſee, and cure this pride) be blind, it ſelfe (with being full of the ſame pride) who ſhall be able to cure it? And if the light grow to be darkenes, and if the very rule of ſtraightneſſe become crooked, what kind of thing, will the reſt be?</p>
               <p>So great are the miſchiefes which grow from pride, that it troubleth al them, with whom it hath to do; for if men will defend their owne opinion in obſtinate manner, and be inſeparable from it, who ſhall be able to liue in peace? And to the end, that thou mayſt fly, &amp; cutſe this vice, know that it arriueth ſo farce, as to make of them that were good Chriſtians, peruerſe Heretikes. Nor haue they beene, nor are they ſuch, for any other reaſon now, but becauſe by giuing more beliefe to their owne iudgment, then to that of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of their <hi>Prelates,</hi> they conceaue themſelues to hit the birde in the eye; and that whatſoeuer paſſeth in their hart, is the worke of

               <p>It will therefore be fit for thee, to take for thy guide and Ghoſtly Father, ſome perſon, who is both<note n="(c)" place="margin">Both learning, &amp; experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are wholy neceſſary to ſuch as are to be the Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of ſpirituall perſons.</note> learned, and of experience, in thinges that belong to God. For without both theſe qualityes (ſpeaking ordinarily) he will not be for the purpoſe.

               <p>This wiſe King, knew well, that inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate looking, is an impediment to ſpeedy run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Carriere of God; and vſeth to make the burning hart of man, grow coole; and therfore it is, that he ſayth, <hi>Quicken me in thy way.</hi> For it is plaine, to men of experience, that how much more retired theſe exteriour eyes vſe to be, ſo much more clearely do men ſee with their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour eyes. And this ſight, is both more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and more profitable. And it is but reaſon, that a Chriſtian man ſhould eaſily belieue thing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:331:153"/>ſince we read of ſome Philoſophers, who did put out the eyes of their body, that they might haue the eyes of their vnderſtanding, more recollected to contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>From<note n="(d)" place="margin">Note how the immorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the eyes, was the occaſion of the firſt great ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eue.</hi>
                  </note> whence doeſt thou thinke, that the beginning of the perdition of the world pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded?

There is no diſcretion to behould that, which it is not lawfull to deſire; as is plaine, by <hi>Dauid</hi> the holy King; whoſe eyes tooke pleaſure in looking vpon a woman, as ſhe was bathing in her garden; and he grew to haue reaſon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to weep dayes and nights; and to bathe his owne bed, &amp; Royall couch with tears in ſo great aboundance, that his eyes, were as if they had been moath-eaten with much weeping. And he that ſayth, <hi>Myne eyes haue powred out, euen floudes of tears, becauſe the wicked haue not kept thy law,</hi> had done better to haue ſhed them, becauſe himſelfe did not keep it. Good counſaile had it beene for his eyes, not to haue taken guſt, in that which

And ſo it will alſo, be good for vs ſinners, ſince we are ſo looſe of the feare, as that, where the eyes go before, the hart with ſpeed goeth after. Let<note n="(e)" place="margin">Note well this whole diſcourſe.</note> vs therefore put a vayle betweene vs, and euery creature; not faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſight wholy vpon any of them; leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there taken vp, we looſe the ſight of our Creatour; That is, thoſe deuout conſiderations which we had of him. And do thou belieue for certaine, that one of the moſt aſſured ſignes of a retyred, and recollected hart, is the mortification of the ſight, and of a diſſolute hart, if the ſight be diſſolute.</p>
               <p>There is no pulſe which ſo aſſuredly declares the diſpoſition of the body, as the eye expreſſeth the inclination of the ſoule, either to good, or euill. And therefore the <hi>Spouſe</hi> doth prayſe the eyes of his fellow <hi>Spouſe,</hi> by ſaying, <hi>That</hi>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let thy firſt care be, to digg deep, in the earth of thy littlenes; till hauing freed all that which thou haſt, from being eſteemed by thy ſelfe, thou come at laſt, to the firme ſtone, which is God; vpon which, &amp; not vpon thyne owne falſe earth, or ſand, thou art to build thy houſe. For this did the bleſſed S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſay, <hi>Thou who thinkeſt to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:331:159"/>rayſe vp a building of vertues take into the firſt part of thy care, the foundation, which is humility for he that pretendeth to haue vertue without it, is like a man that would carry aſhes in his hand, against the wind</hi> This he ſayth, not only becauſe vertues do not profit men without <hi>humility</hi> (though rather indeed without it, they be no vertues) but for that they are an occaſion of great perdition, as a great building vpon a ſleight, and weake foundation, would be ſure of a great fall.</p>
               <p>According therefore to the height of other vertues, the foundation of <hi>humility</hi> is to be layd low; to the end that the ſoule may be firme, and not puffed firſt vp, &amp; then down by the wind of <hi>Pride.</hi> And if thou ſay, where ſhall I find this pretious iewell of <hi>the knowledge of my ſelfe?</hi> I tell thee, that although it be of great valew, yet<note n="(b)" place="margin">Wher humility is to be found.</note> art thou to find it in the ſtable; and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the dung of thyne owne pouertyes, and infirmityes, remouing thyne eyes from looking on the liues of others. Do not buſy thy ſelfe to know curious thinges; but turne in thy ſight, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thy ſoule: and continue in examining of thy ſelfe.

And there be thou in reading of ſpirituall books and continuall prayer, and in the thoughts of another life, and they ſo firme, as that all the employments of the rest of the day, may be made light to thee, by this tyme of thy retraite. Nor do I yet ſay this, to withdraw thee from the gouernement of thy houſe, but rather that ſo thou mayst learne thereby, and conſider how thou art to carry thy ſelfe therein.</hi> If this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saint do recommend to a marryed woman, that ſhe free her ſelf from the buſines of her houſe for ſome tyme, and retyre her ſelf into ſome quiet place, to read, and thinke of heauenly thinges; with how much more reaſon is it, that a Virgin of Chriſt, who is free from worldly cares; and who ſhould thinke that ſhe liueth not for any thing els ſo particulerly, as to frequent prayer, &amp; to practiſe both interiour and exteriour recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, ſhould ſeeke out ſome priuate, and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den place of her houſe, wherein ſhe may haue her deuout books, and deuout pictures; and that the ſame place may be only deputed, to the vſe <hi>of ſeeing, and taſting, how ſweet our Lord is.</hi>

               <p>A ſhameful thing it is for any Chriſtian not to exerciſe himſelfe in reading of ſpirituall bookes;

But that of all the good that may be in vs, we are perfectly to giue the glory,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:331:170"/>to <hi>the Father of lights, from whome all good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gifts deſcend.</hi> So that, although we may haue a thing that is good, we muſt looke vpon it as none of ours; and we muſt vſe it with ſo great fidelity, as not to pretend for the glory which is due to God, nor that the hony (as the Prouerbe ſayth) may be found ſticking to our fingers ends. This humility is not of ſinners, as the firſt was, but of iuſt perſons.</p>
               <p>Not only is this kind of humility in this world, but in heauen alſo.

This was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the ſacred Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> our <hi>B. Lady;</hi> who being preached for happy, and bleſſed by the mouth of <hi>S.

               <p>This very humility (and that which was

I am ſure I neuer ſaw any, that I liked ſo well.</note> who are much exerciſed in the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of themſelues, (in reſpect that they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually viewing their defects ſo neer at hand) are wont to fall into great ſadnes, and diſconfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and puſillanimity; for which reaſon, it is neceſſary that they do exerciſe themſelues alſo in another <hi>knowledge,</hi> which giueth comfort, and ſtrength, much more then the other gaue diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. And againſt this inconuenience there is no other <hi>knowledge</hi> (which may compare with that) of <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt our Lord, eſpecially if we conſider, how he ſuffered, and dyed for vs. This is the cheereful newes, which in the new law was preached, <hi>to all ſuch as are of broken hart;</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is miniſtred a kind of Phyſicke, which is more efficacious towards their comfort, then they can be diſcomforted, by the woundes, and ſoares of their owneſoules.</p>
               <p>This crucifyed Lord, is he, who cheereth them vp, whom the <hi>knowledge</hi> of their owne ſins afflicteth; and he it is that abſolueth, whome the law condemneth, &amp; maketh them ſonnes of God,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:331:181"/>who were ſlaues of the Diuell. This Lord they muſt procure to <hi>know;</hi> and they who are ſubiect to the ſpirituall debtes, which they haue made by finne; and they who find ſtraitnes, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſorrow at their hart, when they conſider themſelues; muſt approach to him, and they ſhal find themſelues well therewith; as heeretofore others that were afflicted, and indebted, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and found help in his ſociety. For as we vſe to giue counſaile, that they who are to paſſe a riuer, ſhould looke vpward, or, at leaſt, out of the water; leaſt their heads may els be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ſome trouble, by ſtaring vpon the running ſtreame; ſo, whoſoeuer ſhall find himſelfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, by the contemplation of his own miſeryes, if he will caſt vp his eyes to Ieſus Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, he may recouer ſtrength. For it was not ſayd in vaine; <hi>My ſoule was troubled within me; and for this reaſon, I remembred thee, of the land of Iordan, and of the hilles of Hermon, &amp; of the little hill.</hi> For the myſteries which Chriſt did worke in his Baptiſme, &amp; Paſſion, are able to quiet any tempeſt of diſtruſt, which riſeth in the hart of man. And ſo it doth; both for that reaſon afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd; as alſo, becauſe there is no<note n="(b)" place="margin">This is the booke of Bookes.</note> booke ſo effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious, towardes the inſtructing of a man, in al kind of vertue, nor how hartily ſinne ought to be abhorred, and vertue loued; as the Paſſion of the Sonne of God. And againe, becauſe it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ingratitude, to put ſuch an immenſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of loue, into obliuion, as that was, in Chriſt
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:331:182"/>to ſuffer for vs.</p>
               <p>It is therefore fit for thee, after the exerciſe of the <hi>knowledge of thy ſelfe</hi> to imploy thy mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vpon <hi>the knowledge of Christ Ieſus our Lord. S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> teacheth vs this, by ſaying, <hi>whoſoeuer hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feeling of Chriſt, doth know how much it belongeth to Chriſtian piety, and how neceſſary it is, and what fruit it bringeth to the ſeruant of God and a ſeruant of the redemption of Chriſt, to remember with attentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, at leaſt, the ſpace of one houre in a day the benefits of the</hi> Paſſion, <hi>and Redemption of Christ Ieſus our Lord; to enioy it ſweetly in our ſoules, and to ſettle it faythfully in our memoryes.</hi> This S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; this he did. And beſides this, thou art to know, That God, when he was pleaſed to communicate the riches of his <hi>Diuinity</hi> to men, imbraced the meanes of making himſelfe a man, that by ſuch baſenes, and pooreneſſe, he might conforme himſelfe to the ſmall capacity of ſuch as were baſe, and poore (and by ioyning himſelfe to them, he might raiſe them vp, to his owne height;) ſo that the way, by which God hath vſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his <hi>Diuinity</hi> to men, hath beene, by meanes of his ſacred <hi>Humanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that gate, by which, whoſoeuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth, ſhallbe ſaued; and it is the ſtaire, by which we muſt aſcend to heauen. For God the Father, is pleaſed to honour the <hi>humanity,</hi> and <hi>humility,</hi> of his only begotten Sonne; ſo far, as not to make friendſhip with any creature, who belieueth not in him; nor to grant his familiar conuerſation,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:331:182"/>but to ſuch as meditate vpon him, with much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Since therefore, there is no reaſon that thou ſhouldſt forbeare to deſire ſo great bleſſings, ſee<note n="(c)" place="margin">If we meane not to be wholy miſerable, we muſt become ſlaues to the Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt our Lord.</note> that thou make thy ſelfe a ſlaue, to this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Paſſion. For as much as, by it thou wert de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, from the captiuity of thy ſinnes, &amp; from the torments of hell; and thoſe other bleſſings, do alſo come to thee by this.

For <hi>Salomon</hi> doth ſignify <hi>peaceable;</hi> &amp; that name was impoſed vpon him, becauſe he made no warrs in his time, as his Father <hi>Dauid</hi> had done.

Eyther<note n="(a)" place="margin">How we are to thinke of the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt our Lord.</note> by repreſenting to thy <hi>imagination,</hi> the corporall figure of Chriſt our Lord; or, by <hi>meerly thinking,</hi> without any <hi>imaginary repreſentation.</hi> And<note n="(b)" place="margin">Note.</note> do thou know, that ſince the moſt high &amp; <hi>inuiſible</hi> God, did make himſelf a <hi>viſible</hi> man, to the end, that, by meanes of that <hi>viſible,</hi> he might conuey into vs the conſideration of that which is <hi>inuiſible;</hi> there is no queſtion, but that it was a very profitable thinge, to behold him with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eyes, that ſo men might come to behold him, with the ſpirituall, which are of <hi>Faith;</hi> if the malice of the looker on, had giuen no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And without doubt, all that which in our Lord was corporall, was excellently ordered; &amp;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:331:197"/>did carry a particuler efficacy, towards the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a pious hart, to raiſe it ſelfe vp, towards <hi>ſpirituall</hi> thinges. Nor was it a ſmall fauour, for them to enioy this ſight, <hi>which many Kinges, and Prophets, deſired to enioy, but obteyned it not.</hi> And although we, that come after, do not enioy this fauour, in ſo complete a manner; yet may we not forbeare to help our ſelues thereby, in the beſt ſort we may. And to this purpoſe, our Mother, the <hi>holy Church,</hi> doth, with great reaſon, propoſe to vs, the images, or pictures of the body of our Lord; that ſo being ſtirred vp thereby, we may remember his corporall preſence; and he may communicate to vs, by meanes of his <hi>reſemblance</hi> ſome part of the much, which would haue been communicated to vs, by his <hi>preſence.</hi> And ſince a picture which is painted without my ſelfe, vpon a piece of wood, doth bring me profit; without doubt, that which is painted within me, and in the <hi>imaginatiue part</hi> of my <hi>mind,</hi> will alſo profit me, by taking it, as a ſteppe, whereby I may be raiſed higher. For<note n="(c)" place="margin">This is moſt certainly true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our Lord be bleſſed, becauſe it is ſo.</note> all that, which hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Lord, and which concerneth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth him; doth carry a meruailous force, towards the conducting vs towards him.</p>
               <p>And although theſe thinges may ſeeme meane to thee; yet becauſe they are a way to hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her thinges, theſe alſo muſt be eſteemed, high.

Her cleanlineſſe, was without being studyed; ſhe was clad without curioſity &amp; adorned without any ornament of dreſsing. And for the pure, and perfect goodnes of her life, ſhe deſerued, that, in euen the Citty of Rome,

               <p>VVE haue made a long digreſſion, from the queſtion that we asked, <hi>How the ſoule could come, by ſuch beauty, as that God ſhould be drawne to a deſire of it.</hi> But the cauſe of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, was the doubt, of our conceauing, that the King perhaps might care for the beauty of the <hi>Body.</hi> Let vs now returne to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Thou art to know, that for the making a thing to be of perfect <hi>beauty,</hi> foure conditions are neceſſary. The firſt, <hi>That it must haue all the parts that belongeth to it;</hi> for if any of them be wanting; as a hand, or foot, or the like, it cannot be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>beautyfull.</hi> The ſecond is, that one part haue proportion with another; and if it be the <hi>picture</hi> of any life, it muſt be made, very like the <hi>originall.</hi> The third is, that it muſt haue purity of colour. The fourth, that it muſt haue a competency of greatnes. For that which is little, though it be well proportioned, will not arriue to be abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompted <hi>beautifull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if<note n="(a)" place="margin">Euery ſoule that is in ſtate of ſinne, is out right defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> we conſider all theſe conditions in a <hi>ſoule,</hi> that is ſinfull; we ſhall finde that it hath no one of them. Not <hi>completenes;</hi> becauſe if it want either <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>charity,</hi> and the giftes of the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:331:286"/>
                  <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> which it was to haue; that cannot be called <hi>beautifull,</hi> to which ſo many thinges are wanting. Againe, one part thereof carryeth no proportion to another; for neither doth <hi>ſenſe,</hi> obey reaſon; nor <hi>reaſon,</hi> God. Eſpecially, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that the <hi>ſoule, being created after the image of God;</hi> it was reaſon, that for the preſeruation of her <hi>beauty,</hi> ſhe ſhould haue reſembled her <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,</hi> in vertue, as ſhee doth in the <hi>naturall being</hi> which ſhe hath. But now God, being <hi>good,</hi> and the <hi>ſoule</hi> being wicked; God being pure, and the ſoule polluted; God being milde, and the ſoule impatient; and ſo in the reſt; how can there be <hi>beauty,</hi> in that <hi>image,</hi> which is ſo vnlike to the <hi>originall?</hi> As for the third, which is, a certaine ſpiritual <hi>light of grace,</hi> &amp; the notions which are to refreſh, &amp; as it were reuiue the <hi>beauty</hi> of the <hi>ſoule</hi> (<hi>as colours</hi> do of the <hi>body</hi>) they are alſo wanting to it; for it walkes in darknes; and it is obſcured, <hi>beyond</hi>

For neither was there any bed for him in the ſtable of <hi>Bethleem,</hi> nor any other place then that. How often did he want meanes, to put away both heate, and cold; and nothing he had, if they gaue him nothing. And if in his life tyme, he had not a place where to lay his head (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe affirmeth) what ſhall we ſay, of that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of pouerty, to which he was ſubiect in his death; at which tyme, neither had he any thing, whereupom ſo much as to lay his head.
